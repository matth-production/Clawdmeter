"""Claude Code PreToolUse hook — routes the approval prompt to Clawdmeter.

Registered in settings.json against a matcher (see README). Claude Code
spawns this once per matching tool call, feeds the tool-call JSON on stdin,
and waits (up to the hook's configured `timeout`) for a decision on stdout.

This script never talks to BLE itself — the usage daemon already owns the
live connection, so this just relays through its Unix socket
(`~/.config/claude-usage-monitor/permission.sock`) and waits for the reply.

Fail-safe design: every exit path below prints valid hookSpecificOutput JSON
and exits 0. On any problem — daemon not running, no device connected, no tap
within the timeout, a crash in this script — the decision is "ask", never
"deny" and never a silent non-decision. "ask" just falls back to Claude
Code's normal terminal/UI prompt, so a hardware hiccup can slow you down but
can never itself block or silently rubber-stamp a tool call.

"Always Allow" persistence: tapping Always writes a standing rule into the
CURRENT PROJECT's `.claude/settings.local.json` `permissions.allow` — the
same file and array Claude Code's own "don't ask again" writes to, using the
same narrow, per-subcommand/per-file scoping it uses (see rules_to_persist).
This hook then self-checks that file on every future call for this project
and answers "allow" immediately, without bothering the device, for anything
already covered. This does NOT rely on Claude Code's own permission engine
noticing the file mid-session (undocumented whether it does) — the checking
happens entirely in this script, which reads the file fresh on every
invocation, so it's correct from the very next tool call onward regardless.
